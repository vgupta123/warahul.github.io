![Image of Me](https://arnabgho.github.io/static/images/fig4.jpg)

I graduated from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in June 2016 and would be joining Professor Philip Torr's Lab for an internship at Oxford from January. I previously worked at Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago with Professor Mohit Bansal and am currently working as an intern at a startup named We Create Problems.

I have been extremely passionate about Artificial Intelligence especially Deep Learning applications on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing.

Some of my key projects include :

* Contextual RNN GAN for Abstract Reasoning Diagram Generation (AAAI-17)
* Message Passing Multi Agent Generative Adversarial Networks
* Improving Visual Question Answering with Dense Captions

I have also worked in the field of High Performance Computing and Parallel Programming . I worked in developing a novel parallel algorithm for solving the Boolean Satisfiability Problem and have implemented it on a NVidia GPU.

I had the chance to work in the High Performance Computing Lab at Carnegie Mellon University and we developed a model for estimating the slowdown of an application while running alongside other applications in a multicore processor .It resulted in a Publication in MICRO 2015.

I also have been quite frequent in the field of Competitive Programming , constantly participating in online Coding platforms such as Topcoder and Codeforces .

Apart from the technical side I am an avid quizzer , having been a National Finalist of the Prestigious Tata Crucible Campus Quiz 2014 , a city winner of the Limca Book of Records Quiz 2011 , a runner up of the esteemed TCS IT WIZ .

I have just recently been interested in Photography and have been learning photography ever since.I love to read novels and basically anything which is a treasure of knowledge .I love to play Squash and hit the gym quite frequently .
