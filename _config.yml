      - name: User Bias Removal in Fine Grained Sentiment Analysis

        text: |
         Major problem in current sentiment classification models is noise due to presence of user biases in reviews rating. We worked on two simple statistical methods to remove user bias noise to improve fine grained sentimental classification. We applied our methods on SNAP published Amazon Fine Food Reviews data-set and two major categories Electronics and Movies & TV of e-Commerce Reviews data-set. We gained improvement on standard evaluation metrics (rmse) for three commonly used feature representation after removing user bias compared to one without removing bias on task of fine grained sentiment analysis.

        text: |
         Generic sentiment and emotion lexicons are widely used for the fine-grained analysis of people's affects and opinions on the world wide web. However, In order to accurately detect affect, there is often a need for domain intelligence, in order to disambiguate the meaning and the perceived interpretation of the same words in different contexts. We proposed an unsupervised approach the construction of domain-specific affect lexicons. This approach can naturally make full use of the mutual reinforcement between topic words and affect words, by incorporating the relationship between topic and affect words at the clause, sentence or document level. Experiments on data sets show that our lexicon provides better coverage than standard lexicons on both short texts as well as long texts, and corresponds well with the affect scores assigned by human annotators in the Crime News domain. We have shown the utility of the our approach in detecting emotion on the SemEval 2007 Affect Corpus, where it outperforms the state of the art generic and domain-specific approaches with a higher F-score and a precision of over 70%
